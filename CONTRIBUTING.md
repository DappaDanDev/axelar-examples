### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies for the project as indicated in the [README.md](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-examples#readme) file.
3. Create a new branch for your contribution with the following command:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch
   ```
4. Make your changes in the new git branch 
5. Commit your changes. Your commit message should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

   ```shell
   git commit -a
   ```
Note: the optional commit `-a' command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub project](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-example/issues) for an open or closed PR related to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
2. Push your branch to GitHub with the following command: 
   ```shell
   git push origin my-fix-branch
   ```
Open a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository.

If we suggest changes then:
   * Make the required updates and commit them to your branch.
   * Wait for the project maintainer to review your changes and merge your Pull Request.


> If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-examples/issues/new/choose).

When you open a new issue, please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the problem and the expected behaviour. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.
